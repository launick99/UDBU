    fragmento en ingles:
    "Under Debbie’s Blue Umbrella" … There are only six results, a very small catch in the vast fishy sea of the Internet, and only one that matches the phrase exactly. 
    Hodges clicks on it and a picture appears. Under a sky filled with threatening clouds is a country hillside. 
    Animated rain — a simple repeating loop, he judges — is pouring down in silvery streams. 
    But the two people seated beneath a large blue umbrella, a young man and a young woman, are safe and dry. 
    They are not kissing, but their heads are close together. They appear to be in deep conversation.”
